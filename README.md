# LambEngine

## Description

A 3D engine developed in C++ using OpenGL and a set of modern libraries to provide efficient rendering and modular features. This project is designed as a simple yet powerful foundation for experimenting with 3D rendering concepts and ECS systems.

## Features

### üé® Graphics Rendering
- **MTL File Parser**: Load and manage materials with support for `ambient`, `diffuse`, and `specular` properties.
- **Phong Illumination**: Realistic simulation of reflections and lighting.
- **Lighting Maps**: Advanced management of lighting textures, including diffuse and specular maps.
- **Lighting System**: Supports directional, point, and spotlights with soft edges.
- **Primitive Creation**: Parametric creation of cubes and spheres.

### üì∑ Camera Management
- Smooth movement using mouse and keyboard.
- FPS and orbital camera modes.
- Powered by the `glm` library for 3D transformations and calculations.

### üõ†Ô∏è ECS (Entity Component System)
- Minimal entity and component management for clear organization of scene objects.
- Easily extendable to add new features like animations or custom behaviors.

### üìÇ File Handling
- Load 3D models via **Assimp** (supported formats: `.obj`, `.fbx`, etc.).
- Parse and manage materials from `.mtl` files.

### üîç Unit Testing
- Built with **Google Test (gtest)** to ensure engine stability and reliability.

### üñ±Ô∏è User Interface
- Integration of **Dear ImGui** for interactive inspection and debugging tools.
